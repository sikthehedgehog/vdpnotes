# Mega Drive VDP Verilog notes

Notes about trying to make sense out of [nukeykt's Verilog conversion of the Mega Drive VDP decap](https://github.com/nukeykt/Nuked-MD-FPGA/blob/main/ym7101.v). Probably full of inaccuracies, you've been warned. Will upload more files later.

`vdp_notes.txt` is probably the main file you're looking for when trying to make sense out of the Verilog code.
