w467     V counter wraparound point (wraps after this line)
w468     (low logic) End of top border (start of display)
w469     (low logic) Start of bottom border (end of display)
w470     End of bottom border (start of bottom TV blank)
w471     Start of top border (end of top TV blank)
w472     Start of vsync (end of bottom TV blank)
w473     End of vsync (start of top TV blank)
w474     ??? (3 lines after w473)
w475     (low logic) line 511 (start of scan)

Not part of the PLA, but w428 is the value loaded into the V counter when it
wraps around.

Not part of the PLA, but w364 is the value loaded into the H counter when it
wraps around.

All of the above *except* w483 are aligned to even pixels, so it's likely that
w483's purpose is something to do with finishing the accesses or the like. Need
to examine the Verilog file further to know for sure.

w486 and w487 overlap in mode 4 (but w487 has more stuff going on in mode 5),
not sure what's going on. Maybe they're used together to trigger different parts
of the circuit?

Yes, w500 and w505 seem to perform double duty.

* H counter wraparound point is actually 1 less than the last value. Since some
  signals seem delayed by 2 cycles this is probably to account for the latency.
* Start and end of hblank take 10px to be visible to the CPU.
* Start and end of hsync take 11px to reach the pin.
* Start of back porch has 2px of latency.
* VSRAM reads seem to have 1px of latency.

** Haven't measured the equalizing pulses but I assume that they have the same
   11px delay that hsync pulses have. I could be wrong though.
